Source & API Documentation
==========================

These pages contain code-level information about Capture The Flag (written in Python) and its interface to the AI Sandboxâ„¢ (written in C++).  They are generated automatically from the codebase itself by Sphinx.  For other high-level documentation and getting started guides, see `the wiki <http://dev.aisandbox.com/wiki>`_.

This source & API documentation is intended for developers keen to extend or modify the CTF codebase and contribute to the project, or advanced programmers writing AI for the game/simulation to compete with others.
