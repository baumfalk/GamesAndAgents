Capture The Flag Source Code
============================

Capture The Flag (CTF) is a simulation about building adaptive commanders, run
within The AI Sandboxâ„¢. Write your commander AI to issue orders to your team of
bots, trying to adapt to defeat the enemy team on a variety of levels.  (See
`AiSandbox.com <http://aisandbox.com/>`_ for details about the game.)

This source code and Mercurial repository is intended for more experienced
programmers who are interested in the underlying implementation of CTF, keen to
contribute new features, or creating advanced commanders that require
understanding of the low-level mechanics.
